            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is John Ojerio Belda and I am in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. While I am retaking Web Development 1 going on my 2<sup>nd</sup> year, I am also working <strong>full time overnights</strong> as I need to pay bills. Though it is hard being a full time student and having a full time job, my passion to succeed as well as graduate and receive a diploma does not amount to the lack of sleep that I have. I believe through <em>perseverance</em> and <em>hardwork</em> of what I am going through right now, it will elevate myself, teach, and learn what life really is about.
            </p>
